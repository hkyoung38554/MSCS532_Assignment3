# MSCS532 Assignment3: Understanding Algorithm Efficiency and Scalability

This project implements and analyzes Randomized Quicksort and Hashing with Chaining. It includes theoretical discussion and empirical performance comparison between randomized and deterministic versions of Quicksort, as well as a custom implementation of a hash table using chaining for collision resolution.

## Files
- `randomized_quicksort.py`: Python implementation of Randomized Quicksort with sample test case
- `hash_table.py`: Python implementation of a hash table using chaining with insert, search, and delete operations
- `report.pdf`: Final report containing implementation details, complexity analysis, runtime comparisons, and discussion
- `performance_test.py`: (Optional) Script for comparing the runtime of Randomized and Deterministic Quicksort

## How to Run
```bash
python randomized_quicksort.py
python hash_table.py
