# MSCS532 Assignment3: Understanding Algorithm Efficiency and Scalability

This project implements and analyzes Randomized Quicksort and Hashing with Chaining. It includes both theoretical analysis and practical testing to evaluate algorithm performance, scalability, and efficiency.

## Files
- `randomized_quicksort.py`: Python implementation of Randomized Quicksort with a test case
- `hash_table.py`: Python implementation of a hash table using chaining for collision resolution
- `Assignment3_Haeri Kyoung.pdf`: Final report detailing implementation, complexity analysis, empirical comparison, and conclusions
- `README.md`: Instructions and summary of the project

## How to Run
```bash
python randomized_quicksort.py
